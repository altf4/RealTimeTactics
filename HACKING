RTT depends on a few packages that are easily available through the Ubuntu/Fedora/openSUSE repositories:

sudo apt-get install libsparsehash-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libois-dev libssl-dev

***Instructions for Ubuntu 11.10/12.04***

>>>>>>> upstream/master

***Instructions for Fedora 16/17 and openSUSE 12.1***
sudo yum install sparsehash-devel gtkmm30-devel openssl-devel boost-devel boost-date-time

########################
OGRE 3D
########################

***Instructions for Ubuntu 11.10/12.04***
The version of OGRE in the default Ubuntu repositories is old / incomplete. So
instead, we use the offical OGRE PPA, avaialble form here:

https://launchpad.net/~ogre-team/+archive/ogre

Also, we require (for now) the OGRE sample media packs:

sudo apt-get install ogre-samples-media ogre-samples-source

***Instructions for Fedora 16/17 and openSUSE 12.1***
The current version in the F16/17 repository is 1.7.3(the Ogre Ubuntu PPA is 1.7.4).
1.7.4 is available only in Rawhide or via the openSUSE build service: https://build.opensuse.org/
In most cases 1.7.3 will work just fine.

sudo yum install ogre-devel ois-devel

Also, we require (for now) the OGRE sample media packs:

sudo yum install ogre-samples

###########################
Building Using Eclipse:
###########################

We use Eclipse as an IDE, and it is strongly recommended if you want to proceed. Unfortunately, the version in the Ubuntu repositories is rather old. So go and grab the latest from the web. Make sure it is the Eclipse CDT. (Not the one marked "for Linux developers")

############
Importing into eclipse:
############

The necessary Eclipse files are already in the repository ready for an easy import. Just hit:

File-> Import-> General-> Existing Projects into Workspace

Then select the RTT parent directory, and it will automatically recognize all the sub-projects.

#############
Eclipse pkg-config plugin
#############

GTK uses pkg-config to automatically load its necessary depencies.
(Since there are a lot) But Eclipse by itself doesn't have support
for this. YOu have to install the pkg-config plugin from the 
Eclipse Marketplace. (Free of course)

Go to Help-> Marketplace-> 
	Then search for "pkg-config" and it should come up. Hit
	the install button and it will just work.

###########################
Building Not Using Eclipse:
###########################

Just navigate to the main directory (where this file is located) and run:

	make
	sudo make install

If you make changes, you may need to clean the source code in order to have it build properly again:

	make clean

If you want to uninstall the program:

	make uninstall
