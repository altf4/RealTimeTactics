RTT depends on a few packages that are easily available through the Ubuntu/Fedora/openSUSE repositories:


***Instructions for Ubuntu 11.10/12.04***
sudo apt-get install libsparsehash-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libois-dev libssl-dev libboost-dev libboost-date-time1.48-dev


***Instructions for Fedora 16/17 and openSUSE 12.1***
sudo yum install sparsehash-devel gtkmm30-devel openssl-devel boost-devel boost-date-time

########################
OGRE 3D
########################

RTT_Client_OGRE relies on OGRE version 1.8.0, which is currently available only as source. 

OGRE Source can be downloaded here: http://www.ogre3d.org/download/source

You need CMake (http://www.cmake.org). In a console, type:
> cd /path/to/ogredeps
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
> make install


RTT_Client_OGRE also requires CEGUI, currently version 0.7.6 found here:

http://www.cegui.org.uk/wiki/index.php/CEGUI_Downloads_0.7.6

Unpack the archive, and run:
> ./configure
> make
> sudo make install

###########################
Building Using Eclipse:
###########################

We use Eclipse as an IDE, and it is strongly recommended if you want to proceed. Unfortunately, the version in the Ubuntu repositories is rather old. So go and grab the latest from the web. Make sure it is the Eclipse CDT. (Not the one marked "for Linux developers")

############
Importing into eclipse:
############

The necessary Eclipse files are already in the repository ready for an easy import. Just hit:

File-> Import-> General-> Existing Projects into Workspace

Then select the RTT parent directory, and it will automatically recognize all the sub-projects.

#############
Eclipse pkg-config plugin
#############

GTK uses pkg-config to automatically load its necessary depencies.
(Since there are a lot) But Eclipse by itself doesn't have support
for this. YOu have to install the pkg-config plugin from the 
Eclipse Marketplace. (Free of course)

Go to Help-> Marketplace-> 
	Then search for "pkg-config" and it should come up. Hit
	the install button and it will just work.

###########################
Building Not Using Eclipse:
###########################

Just navigate to the main directory (where this file is located) and run:

	make
	sudo make install

If you make changes, you may need to clean the source code in order to have it build properly again:

	make clean

If you want to uninstall the program:

	make uninstall
